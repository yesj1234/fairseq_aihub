    #         Whether to run evaluation on the validation set or not. Will be set to `True` if `evaluation_strategy` is
    #         different from `"no"`. This argument is not directly used by [`Trainer`], it's intended to be used by your
    #         training/evaluation scripts instead. See the [example
    #         scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) for more details.

    #         If set to a positive number, the total number of training steps to perform. Overrides `num_train_epochs`.
    #         In case of using a finite iterable dataset the training may stop before reaching the set number of steps
    #         when all data is exhausted
    #     lr_scheduler_type (`str` or [`SchedulerType`], *optional*, defaults to `"linear"`):

    #     log_level (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `passive`):
    #         Logger log level to use on the main process. Possible choices are the log levels as strings: 'debug',
    #         'info', 'warning', 'error' and 'critical', plus a 'passive' level which doesn't set anything and keeps the
    #         current log level for the Transformers library (which will be `"warning"` by default).
    #     log_level_replica (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"warning"`):
    #         Logger log level to use on replicas. Same choices as `log_level`"

    #         `logging_nan_inf_filter` only influences the logging of loss values, it does not change the behavior the
    #         gradient is computed or applied to the model.

    #         </Tip>

    #     save_total_limit (`int`, *optional*):
    #         If a value is passed, will limit the total amount of checkpoints. Deletes the older checkpoints in
    #         `output_dir`. When `load_best_model_at_end` is enabled, the "best" checkpoint according to

    #         `save_total_limit=5` and `load_best_model_at_end`, the four last checkpoints will always be retained
    #         alongside the best model. When `save_total_limit=1` and `load_best_model_at_end`, it is possible that two
    #         checkpoints are saved: the last one and the best one (if they are different).
    #     save_safetensors (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Use [safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors) saving and loading for state dicts instead of

    #         When doing multi-node distributed training, whether to save models and checkpoints on each node, or only on
    #         the main one.

    #         This should not be activated when the different nodes use the same storage as the files will be saved with
    #         the same names for each node.
    #     use_cpu (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether or not to use cpu. If set to False, we will use cuda or mps device if available.
    #     seed (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 42):
    #         Random seed that will be set at the beginning of training. To ensure reproducibility across runs, use the

    #     data_seed (`int`, *optional*):
    #         Random seed to be used with data samplers. If not set, random generators for data sampling will use the

    #         seed.
    #     jit_mode_eval (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether or not to use PyTorch jit trace for inference.

    #     bf16 (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether to use bf16 16-bit (mixed) precision training instead of 32-bit training. Requires Ampere or higher
    #         NVIDIA architecture or using CPU (use_cpu). This is an experimental API and it may change.
    #     fp16 (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether to use fp16 16-bit (mixed) precision training instead of 32-bit training.

    #         will force the requested backend.
    #     bf16_full_eval (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether to use full bfloat16 evaluation instead of 32-bit. This will be faster and save memory but can harm

    #     fp16_full_eval (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether to use full float16 evaluation instead of 32-bit. This will be faster and save memory but can harm
    #         metric values.
    #     tf32 (`bool`, *optional*):
    #         Whether to enable the TF32 mode, available in Ampere and newer GPU architectures. The default value depends
    #         on PyTorch's version default of `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32`. For more details please refer to
    #         the [TF32](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/performance#tf32) documentation. This is an

    #     eval_steps (`int` or `float`, *optional*):
    #         Number of update steps between two evaluations if `evaluation_strategy="steps"`. Will default to the same
    #         value as `logging_steps` if not set. Should be an integer or a float in range `[0,1)`. If smaller than 1,
    #         will be interpreted as ratio of total training steps.
    #     dataloader_num_workers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
    #         Number of subprocesses to use for data loading (PyTorch only). 0 means that the data will be loaded in the
    #         main process.
    #     past_index (`int`, *optional*, defaults to -1):
    #         Some models like [TransformerXL](../model_doc/transformerxl) or [XLNet](../model_doc/xlnet) can make use of
    #         the past hidden states for their predictions. If this argument is set to a positive int, the `Trainer` will
    #         use the corresponding output (usually index 2) as the past state and feed it to the model at the next
    #         training step under the keyword argument `mems`.
    #     run_name (`str`, *optional*):
    #         A descriptor for the run. Typically used for [wandb](https://www.wandb.com/) and

    #     remove_unused_columns (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
    #         Whether or not to automatically remove the columns unused by the model forward method.

    #         (Note that this behavior is not implemented for [`TFTrainer`] yet.)
    #     label_names (`List[str]`, *optional*):
    #         The list of keys in your dictionary of inputs that correspond to the labels.

    #         Will eventually default to the list of argument names accepted by the model that contain the word "label",
    #         except if the model used is one of the `XxxForQuestionAnswering` in which case it will also include the
    #         `["start_positions", "end_positions"]` keys.
    #     load_best_model_at_end (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether or not to load the best model found during training at the end of training. When this option is

    #         for more.

    #         <Tip>

    #         When set to `True`, the parameters `save_strategy` needs to be the same as `evaluation_strategy`, and in
    #         the case it is "steps", `save_steps` must be a round multiple of `eval_steps`.

    #         models. Must be the name of a metric returned by the evaluation with or without the prefix `"eval_"`. Will
    #         default to `"loss"` if unspecified and `load_best_model_at_end=True` (to use the evaluation loss).

    #         If you set this value, `greater_is_better` will default to `True`. Don't forget to set it to `False` if

    #     ignore_data_skip (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         When resuming training, whether or not to skip the epochs and batches to get the data loading at the same
    #         stage as in the previous training. If set to `True`, the training will begin faster (as that skipping step
    #         can take a long time) but will not yield the same results as the interrupted training would have.

    #           Zero-3 mode (with `reshard_after_forward=True`).
    #         - `"offload"`: to add ZeRO-offload (only compatible with `"zero_dp_2"` and `"zero_dp_3"`).

    #         If a string is passed, it will be split on space. If a bool is passed, it will be converted to an empty
    #         list for `False` and `["simple"]` for `True`.
    #     fsdp (`bool`, `str` or list of [`~trainer_utils.FSDPOption`], *optional*, defaults to `''`):
    #         Use PyTorch Distributed Parallel Training (in distributed training only).

    #     fsdp_config (`str` or `dict`, *optional*):
    #         Config to be used with fsdp (Pytorch Distributed Parallel Training). The value is either a location of

    #         A List of config and its options:
    #             - min_num_params (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `0`):
    #                 FSDP's minimum number of parameters for Default Auto Wrapping. (useful only when `fsdp` field is

    #                 FSDP's backward prefetch mode. Controls when to prefetch next set of parameters (useful only when
    #                 `fsdp` field is passed).

    #                 A list of options along the following:

    #                 - `"backward_pre"` : Prefetches the next set of parameters before the current set of parameter's
    #                   gradient
    #                     computation.
    #                 - `"backward_post"` : This prefetches the next set of parameters after the current set of
    #                   parameter’s
    #                     gradient computation.
    #             - forward_prefetch (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`)
    #                 FSDP's forward prefetch mode (useful only when `fsdp` field is passed).
    #                  If `"True"`, then FSDP explicitly prefetches the next upcoming all-gather while executing in the
    #                  forward pass.
    #             - limit_all_gathers (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`)
    #                 FSDP's limit_all_gathers (useful only when `fsdp` field is passed).
    #                  If `"True"`, FSDP explicitly synchronizes the CPU thread to prevent too many in-flight
    #                  all-gathers.
    #             - use_orig_params (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`)
    #                 If `"True"`, allows non-uniform `requires_grad` during init, which means support for interspersed
    #                 frozen and trainable paramteres. Useful in cases such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Please
    #                 refer this
    #                 [blog](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/rethinking-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-fsdp-from-first-principles/1019
    #             - sync_module_states (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`)
    #                 If `"True"`, each individually wrapped FSDP unit will broadcast module parameters from rank 0 to
    #                 ensure they are the same across all ranks after initialization
    #             - xla (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #                 Whether to use PyTorch/XLA Fully Sharded Data Parallel Training. This is an experimental feature
    #                 and its API may evolve in the future.
    #             - xla_fsdp_settings (`dict`, *optional*)
    #                 The value is a dictionary which stores the XLA FSDP wrapping parameters.

    #                 For a complete list of options, please see [here](
    #                 https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/torch_xla/distributed/fsdp/xla_fully_sharded_data_parallel.py).
    #             - xla_fsdp_grad_ckpt (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #                 Will use gradient checkpointing over each nested XLA FSDP wrapped layer. This setting can only be
    #                 used when the xla flag is set to true, and an auto wrapping policy is specified through
    #                 fsdp_min_num_params or fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap.

    #     deepspeed (`str` or `dict`, *optional*):
    #         Use [Deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed). This is an experimental feature and its API may
    #         evolve in the future. The value is either the location of DeepSpeed json config file (e.g.,
    #         `ds_config.json`) or an already loaded json file as a `dict`"
    #     label_smoothing_factor (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
    #         The label smoothing factor to use. Zero means no label smoothing, otherwise the underlying onehot-encoded
    #         labels are changed from 0s and 1s to `label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` and `1 - label_smoothing_factor +
    #         label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` respectively.
    #     debug (`str` or list of [`~debug_utils.DebugOption`], *optional*, defaults to `""`):
    #         Enable one or more debug features. This is an experimental feature.

    #         Possible options are:

    #         - `"underflow_overflow"`: detects overflow in model's input/outputs and reports the last frames that led to
    #           the event
    #         - `"tpu_metrics_debug"`: print debug metrics on TPU

    #         The options should be separated by whitespaces.
    #     optim (`str` or [`training_args.OptimizerNames`], *optional*, defaults to `"adamw_torch"`):
    #         The optimizer to use: adamw_hf, adamw_torch, adamw_torch_fused, adamw_apex_fused, adamw_anyprecision or
    #         adafactor.
    #     optim_args (`str`, *optional*):
    #         Optional arguments that are supplied to AnyPrecisionAdamW.
    #     group_by_length (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether or not to group together samples of roughly the same length in the training dataset (to minimize
    #         padding applied and be more efficient). Only useful if applying dynamic padding.
    #     length_column_name (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"length"`):
    #         Column name for precomputed lengths. If the column exists, grouping by length will use these values rather
    #         than computing them on train startup. Ignored unless `group_by_length` is `True` and the dataset is an
    #         instance of `Dataset`.
    #     report_to (`str` or `List[str]`, *optional*, defaults to `"all"`):
    #         The list of integrations to report the results and logs to. Supported platforms are `"azure_ml"`,
    #         `"clearml"`, `"codecarbon"`, `"comet_ml"`, `"dagshub"`, `"flyte"`, `"mlflow"`, `"neptune"`,
    #         `"tensorboard"`, and `"wandb"`. Use `"all"` to report to all integrations installed, `"none"` for no
    #         integrations.
    #     ddp_find_unused_parameters (`bool`, *optional*):
    #         When using distributed training, the value of the flag `find_unused_parameters` passed to
    #         `DistributedDataParallel`. Will default to `False` if gradient checkpointing is used, `True` otherwise.
    #     ddp_bucket_cap_mb (`int`, *optional*):
    #         When using distributed training, the value of the flag `bucket_cap_mb` passed to `DistributedDataParallel`.
    #     ddp_broadcast_buffers (`bool`, *optional*):
    #         When using distributed training, the value of the flag `broadcast_buffers` passed to
    #         `DistributedDataParallel`. Will default to `False` if gradient checkpointing is used, `True` otherwise.
    #     dataloader_pin_memory (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
    #         Whether you want to pin memory in data loaders or not. Will default to `True`.
    #     skip_memory_metrics (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
    #         Whether to skip adding of memory profiler reports to metrics. This is skipped by default because it slows
    #         down the training and evaluation speed.
    #     push_to_hub (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether or not to push the model to the Hub every time the model is saved. If this is activated,
    #         `output_dir` will begin a git directory synced with the repo (determined by `hub_model_id`) and the content
    #         will be pushed each time a save is triggered (depending on your `save_strategy`). Calling
    #         [`~Trainer.save_model`] will also trigger a push.

    #         <Tip warning={true}>

    #         If `output_dir` exists, it needs to be a local clone of the repository to which the [`Trainer`] will be
    #         pushed.

    #         </Tip>

    #     resume_from_checkpoint (`str`, *optional*):
    #         The path to a folder with a valid checkpoint for your model. This argument is not directly used by
    #         [`Trainer`], it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See the [example
    #         scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) for more details.
    #     hub_model_id (`str`, *optional*):
    #         The name of the repository to keep in sync with the local *output_dir*. It can be a simple model ID in
    #         which case the model will be pushed in your namespace. Otherwise it should be the whole repository name,
    #         for instance `"user_name/model"`, which allows you to push to an organization you are a member of with
    #         `"organization_name/model"`. Will default to `user_name/output_dir_name` with *output_dir_name* being the
    #         name of `output_dir`.

    #         Will default to the name of `output_dir`.
    #     hub_strategy (`str` or [`~trainer_utils.HubStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `"every_save"`):
    #         Defines the scope of what is pushed to the Hub and when. Possible values are:

    #         - `"end"`: push the model, its configuration, the tokenizer (if passed along to the [`Trainer`]) and a
    #           draft of a model card when the [`~Trainer.save_model`] method is called.
    #         - `"every_save"`: push the model, its configuration, the tokenizer (if passed along to the [`Trainer`]) and
    #           a draft of a model card each time there is a model save. The pushes are asynchronous to not block
    #           training, and in case the save are very frequent, a new push is only attempted if the previous one is
    #           finished. A last push is made with the final model at the end of training.
    #         - `"checkpoint"`: like `"every_save"` but the latest checkpoint is also pushed in a subfolder named
    #           last-checkpoint, allowing you to resume training easily with
    #           `trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint="last-checkpoint")`.
    #         - `"all_checkpoints"`: like `"checkpoint"` but all checkpoints are pushed like they appear in the output
    #           folder (so you will get one checkpoint folder per folder in your final repository)

    #     hub_token (`str`, *optional*):
    #         The token to use to push the model to the Hub. Will default to the token in the cache folder obtained with
    #         `huggingface-cli login`.
    #     hub_private_repo (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         If True, the Hub repo will be set to private.
    #     hub_always_push (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Unless this is `True`, the `Trainer` will skip pushing a checkpoint when the previous push is not finished.
    #     gradient_checkpointing (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         If True, use gradient checkpointing to save memory at the expense of slower backward pass.
    #     include_inputs_for_metrics (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether or not the inputs will be passed to the `compute_metrics` function. This is intended for metrics
    #         that need inputs, predictions and references for scoring calculation in Metric class.
    #     auto_find_batch_size (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`)
    #         Whether to find a batch size that will fit into memory automatically through exponential decay, avoiding
    #         CUDA Out-of-Memory errors. Requires accelerate to be installed (`pip install accelerate`)
    #     full_determinism (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`)
    #         If `True`, [`enable_full_determinism`] is called instead of [`set_seed`] to ensure reproducible results in
    #         distributed training. Important: this will negatively impact the performance, so only use it for debugging.
    #     torchdynamo (`str`, *optional*):
    #         If set, the backend compiler for TorchDynamo. Possible choices are `"eager"`, `"aot_eager"`, `"inductor"`,
    #         `"nvfuser"`, `"aot_nvfuser"`, `"aot_cudagraphs"`, `"ofi"`, `"fx2trt"`, `"onnxrt"` and `"ipex"`.
    #     ray_scope (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"last"`):
    #         The scope to use when doing hyperparameter search with Ray. By default, `"last"` will be used. Ray will
    #         then use the last checkpoint of all trials, compare those, and select the best one. However, other options
    #         are also available. See the [Ray documentation](
    #         https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/analysis.html#ray.tune.ExperimentAnalysis.get_best_trial) for
    #         more options.
    #     ddp_timeout (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1800):
    #         The timeout for `torch.distributed.init_process_group` calls, used to avoid GPU socket timeouts when
    #         performing slow operations in distributed runnings. Please refer the [PyTorch documentation]
    #         (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#torch.distributed.init_process_group) for more
    #         information.
    #     use_mps_device (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         This argument is deprecated.`mps` device will be used if it is available similar to `cuda` device.
    #     torch_compile (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
    #         Whether or not to compile the model using PyTorch 2.0
    #         [`torch.compile`](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/).

    #         This will use the best defaults for the [`torch.compile`
    #         API](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.compile.html?highlight=torch+compile#torch.compile).
    #         You can customize the defaults with the argument `torch_compile_backend` and `torch_compile_mode` but we
    #         don't guarantee any of them will work as the support is progressively rolled in in PyTorch.

    #         This flag and the whole compile API is experimental and subject to change in future releases.
    #     torch_compile_backend (`str`, *optional*):
    #         The backend to use in `torch.compile`. If set to any value, `torch_compile` will be set to `True`.

    #         Refer to the PyTorch doc for possible values and note that they may change across PyTorch versions.

    #         This flag is experimental and subject to change in future releases.
    #     torch_compile_mode (`str`, *optional*):
    #         The mode to use in `torch.compile`. If set to any value, `torch_compile` will be set to `True`.

    #         Refer to the PyTorch doc for possible values and note that they may change across PyTorch versions.

    #         This flag is experimental and subject to change in future releases.
